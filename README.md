# cvip_project
I've taken CSE 573, Computer Vision & Image Processing as part of my curriculum. As part of the course work, I've worked on two projects.

Project1

task1.py: In this task, we had to rotate the given 3-d matrix from xyz to XYZ position and vice-versa.

task2.py: We were given a chessboard and we need to find out its corner coordinates in a 2-d image.


Project2

task1.py: we have to stitch two images, given that we can't use any library/in-built API/function which contains ‘stitch’ or ‘match’ in their name, we need to manually calculate the homography matrix.

task2.py: we were given images having salt-and-pepper noise, we need to produce the denoised image using the median filter. In the denoised image, we need to detect horizontal and vertical edges. The bonus task was to find out edges along 45 degrees and 135 degrees.

task3.py: The goal of this task is to experiment with commonly used morphology in binary image processing techniques (erosion, dilation, open and close), to remove noises and extract the boundary of a binary image.


P.S. If you want to use this code, please give a proper reference.
