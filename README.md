I've taken CSE 573, Computer Vision & Image Processing as part of my curriculum. As part of course work I've worked on two projects.


Project1

task1.py: In this task we've to rotate the given 3-d matrix from xyz to XYZ position and vice-versa.

task2.py: We were given a chessboard and we need to find out it's corner coordinates in 2-d image.



Project2

task1.py: we have to stitch two image, given that we can't use any library/in-built API/function which contains ‘stitch’ or ‘match’ in their name, we need to manually calculate homogrpahy matrix.

task2.py: we were given images having salt-and-pepper noise, we need to produced the denoised image using median filter. In the denoised image, we need to detect horizontal and vertical edges. Bonus task was to find out edges along 45 degree and 135 degree.

task3.py: The goal of this task is to experiment with commonly used morphology in binary image processing techniques (erosion, dilation, open and close), to remove noises and extract boundary of a binary image.
